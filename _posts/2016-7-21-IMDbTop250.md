title: IMDb Top 250 Movies -- Data Analysis
---
In this project, we examine data on the top 250-rated movies on IMDb.com.  Data is obtained via both the IMDBpie API (https://github.com/richardasaurus/imdb-pie) and scraping with BeautifulSoup.  

Since we are tasked with determining which factors most accurately predict user rating, let's take a look at the distribution of number of voters:

The general shape of the histogram makes sense; we expect the distribution of number of votes for ALL movies to be normal, not just the top 250.  Since we are only looking at the righthand slice of that, the mean of the total distribution should be on the left.  In the tail are blockbuster hits with millions of votes.

What kinds of ratings do we see in the top 250 movies?  Relatively high, clearly!  Here are some stats and a histogram to illustrate:

mean       8.315200

min        8.000000

median     8.300000

max        9.300000

What are the release years for the top 250 movies?  Perhaps unsurprisingly (when taking into account the present year and when the internet/IMDb came into full swing), a larger proportion of the movies at the top of the list were released sooner rather than later.  What size population is going to vote up a Charlie Chaplin movie in 2016?  A small one, possibly size 0!  With a bar space for each year, we can see that 1957, 1995, and 2015/16 (to date) had the most movies.

1957:  12 Angry Men, Paths of Glory, Witness for the Prosecution, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Nights of Cabiria, Throne of Blood

1995:  Se7en, The Usual Suspects, Braveheart, Toy Story, Heat, Casino, Before Sunrise, Twelve Monkeys, La Haine

The plot below displays very nicely an apparent positive correlation between number of votes and user rating of a movie in the Top 250.  Additionally, we see with the aid of color that older movies (colder, blue) tend to have fewer votes AND a lower rating than newer movies (red, warmer):

What time of year are most movies released?  Well, of the top 250
