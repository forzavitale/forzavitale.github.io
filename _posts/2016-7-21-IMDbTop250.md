title: IMDb Top 250 Movies: Data Analysis
---
In this project, we examine data on the top 250-rated movies on IMDb.com.  Data is obtained via both the IMDBpie API (https://github.com/richardasaurus/imdb-pie) and scraping with BeautifulSoup.  

Since we are tasked with determining which factors most accurately predict user rating, let's take a look at the distribution of number of voters:

The general shape of the histogram makes sense; we expect the distribution of number of votes for ALL movies to be normal, not just the top 250.  Since we are only looking at the righthand slice of that, the mean of the total distribution should be on the left.  In the tail are blockbuster hits with millions of votes.
