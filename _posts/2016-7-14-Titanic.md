title: Titanic Passengers -- Who Survived?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, we use logistic regression on the widely-available Titanic passenger data set to predict passenger survival.  For 891 passenger observations, features provided include: survival status, passenger class, full name, sex, age, number of siblings on board, number of parents/children on board, ticket information, fare paid, cabin information, and point of embarkation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although about 20% of ages are missing from the data set, a histogram shows a roughly normal distribution of age around 30 years, with at least 40 children.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the following scatterplot of fare paid vs age of passenger, we can see for example young males and well-paying females had relatively high survival rates. It appears that most males who paid no fare did not survive (no females paid no fare).  There were not as many older women as older men, either alive or dead; further, almost all of them survived. The 80 year old man perhaps got helped off because he was so old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four most important features in determining survival status in our model ended up being: number of siblings on board, 3rd class status, and a title of either 'Mr' or an officer-rank.  The model gives the following confusion matrix:
