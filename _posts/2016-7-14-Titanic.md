title: Titanic Passengers -- Who Survived?
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, we use logistic regression on the widely-available Titanic passenger data set [to predict passenger survival](https://github.com/forzavitale/DSI-projects/blob/master/Titanic_Survival/Titanic_project.ipynb).  The original dataset includes 891 passenger observations of the following features: survival status, passenger class, full name, sex, age, number of siblings on board, number of parents/children on board, ticket information, fare paid, cabin information, and point of embarkation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although about 20% of ages are missing from the data set, this histogram shows a roughly normal distribution of age around 30 years, with at least 40 children.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this scatterplot of fare vs passenger age, we can see, for example, that young males and well-paying females had relatively high survival rates. It appears that most males who paid no fare did not survive (no females paid no fare).  There were not as many older women as older men, either alive or dead; further, almost all of the older females survived. We can imagine that the 80 year old man perhaps got helped off because he was so old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four most important features in determining survival status in our model ended up being: number of siblings on board, 3rd class status, a title of 'Mr', and an officer rank ('Rev,' 'Dr,' et al.).  All of these are negatively correlated with survival (morbid!).  The model's predictions give us the following confusion matrix:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The model, which uses an L1 penalty, has about an 84% accuracy.  In order to improve the model, we could try imputing age but I'm not a huge fan of imputation; title seems to be a good proxy for age, here, anyway.  I'm curious if anyone has a resource on the ticket feature... I started trying to break down each ticket value by prefix and number, but the prefixes are inconsistent and it would help to know what they mean.
